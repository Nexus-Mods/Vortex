# OAuth and React Component Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **OAuth `invalid_grant` Error**: Users were getting authentication failures when trying to install mods from Nexus Mods even when logged in.

2. **React Controlled Component Warning**: A warning was appearing in the console about a component changing from controlled to uncontrolled.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. OAuth Error Handling Improvements

**File**: `src/extensions/nexus_integration/util/oauth.ts`

- Enhanced error handling in the `postRequest` method to provide more descriptive error messages for `invalid_grant` errors
- Added special handling for network/SSL errors that might be related to token issues
- Improved error parsing to better identify and handle token-related problems

### 2. React Controlled Component Fix

**File**: `src/controls/PlaceholderTextArea.tsx`

- Fixed the controlled component warning by properly managing the component's state
- Added a `value` prop to make the component properly controlled
- Implemented proper state synchronization between props and internal state
- Ensured the component always has a defined value to prevent uncontrolled behavior

### 3. CopyClipboardInput Component Fix

**File**: `src/controls/CopyClipboardInput.tsx`

- Added protection against undefined `inputValue` props
- Ensured the component always renders with a valid string value
- Prevented potential issues with React's controlled component expectations

### 4. LoginDialog Integration

**File**: `src/extensions/nexus_integration/views/LoginDialog.tsx`

- Updated the component to properly pass the `value` prop to `PlaceholderTextArea`
- Ensured proper data flow between the login dialog state and the text area component

### 5. OAuth Token Management

**File**: `src/extensions/nexus_integration/util.ts`

- Added a `clearOAuthCredentials` function to properly clear invalid tokens
- Enhanced the `updateToken` function with better error handling for `invalid_grant` errors
- Added automatic credential clearing when token refresh fails
- Improved error messages to guide users on how to resolve authentication issues

### 6. Event Handler Improvements

**File**: `src/extensions/nexus_integration/eventHandlers.ts`

- Added timeout protection to the `onOAuthTokenChanged` handler to prevent hanging on invalid tokens
- Improved error handling for token refresh failures
- Added proper cleanup when token updates fail

## Expected Outcomes

1. **OAuth Issues**: Users should no longer encounter `invalid_grant` errors when they are properly logged in. If token issues do occur, they will receive clear guidance on how to resolve them.

2. **React Warnings**: The controlled component warning should no longer appear in the console.

3. **Better User Experience**: Improved error messages and automatic recovery mechanisms for authentication issues.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test OAuth login flow with valid credentials
2. Test error handling with invalid/expired tokens
3. Verify that the React warning no longer appears
4. Test copy/paste functionality in the login dialog
5. Verify that credential clearing works properly when authentication fails
