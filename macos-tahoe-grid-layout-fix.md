# macOS Tahoe Theme Grid Layout Fix

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the dashlet overlapping issue in the macOS Tahoe theme by implementing a CSS grid layout.

## Problem
The dashlets in the macOS Tahoe theme were overlapping because they were using a flex layout without proper wrapping, causing them to stack on top of each other.

## Solution
Implemented a CSS grid layout for the dashlet container to ensure proper positioning and prevent overlapping.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dashboard Styling
Modified the `.dynamic-dashlets` class in `#page-dashboard` to use CSS Grid:

```scss
.dynamic-dashlets {
  background: transparent;
  padding: 0;
  padding-right: $spacing-lg;
  // Use CSS Grid to prevent dashlet overlapping
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(200px, auto);
  grid-gap: $spacing-md;
}
```

### 2. Updated Dashlet Styling
Removed margins from dashlets that were interfering with the grid layout:

```scss
.dashlet,
.applet,
.widget {
  // ... other styles ...
  // Remove margins that interfere with grid layout
  margin: 0;
}
```

### 3. Updated Go Premium Dashlet
Removed margins that were interfering with the grid layout:

```scss
.dashlet-go-premium {
  // ... other styles ...
  // Remove margins that interfere with grid layout
  margin: 0;
  // ... other styles ...
}
```

### 4. Updated Dashlet Container
Changed the display property to `contents` to ensure proper grid behavior:

```scss
.dashlet-container,
.content-dashlets,
.main-content-dashlets {
  display: contents;
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Overlapping**: Dashlets now properly align in a grid without overlapping
2. **Responsive Layout**: The grid automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
3. **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform gaps between dashlets
4. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Cleaner organization of dashboard content

## Grid Layout Details

- **Columns**: `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))` - Creates as many columns as possible with a minimum width of 300px
- **Rows**: `minmax(200px, auto)` - Rows have a minimum height of 200px but can expand as needed
- **Gap**: `$spacing-md` - Consistent spacing between grid items

This implementation ensures that dashlets will:
- Never overlap
- Automatically reflow based on available space
- Maintain consistent spacing
- Work well on different screen sizes
