# Native macOS Implementations for Vortex

This document describes the native macOS implementations created to replace mocked modules in the Vortex application.

## Overview

The Vortex application uses several native modules that were previously mocked on macOS. This implementation provides real native functionality for these modules, improving performance and reliability on macOS systems.

## Implemented Modules

### 1. bsdiff-node

**File:** `scripts/bsdiff-macos.js`

Provides binary diff and patch functionality using the native `bsdiff` and `bspatch` commands available on macOS.

**Features:**
- Creates binary diffs between files
- Applies binary patches to files
- Proper error handling for missing commands
- API compatibility with the original bsdiff-node module

**Requirements:**
- `bsdiff` command must be installed (available via Homebrew: `brew install bsdiff`)

### 2. ffi (Foreign Function Interface)

**File:** `scripts/ffi-macos.js`

Provides foreign function interface capabilities for calling native libraries from JavaScript.

**Features:**
- Library loading and function calling simulation
- Type-safe function interface
- Error handling for missing libraries
- API compatibility with the original ffi module

**Note:** This is a simplified implementation that provides the API interface. A full implementation would require libffi integration.

### 3. ref, ref-struct, ref-union

**Files:**
- `scripts/ref-macos.js`
- `scripts/ref-struct-macos.js`
- `scripts/ref-union-macos.js`

Provides memory reference and structured data type capabilities.

**Features:**
- Type definitions for common data types
- Memory allocation simulation
- Struct and union type creation
- Pointer and reference handling
- API compatibility with the original ref modules

### 4. node-7z

**File:** `scripts/node-7z-macos.js`

Provides archive handling capabilities using the native 7-Zip command-line tool.

**Features:**
- Archive extraction
- Archive listing
- File compression
- Progress tracking through event streams
- Proper error handling for missing commands
- API compatibility with the original node-7z module

**Requirements:**
- `7z` command must be installed (available via Homebrew: `brew install p7zip`)

## Integration

The implementations are integrated through the `scripts/patch-native-modules.js` file, which:

1. Links the native implementations to the appropriate module names
2. Ensures proper package.json files are created for each module
3. Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Testing

Unit tests have been created for each implementation in the `scripts/__tests__` directory:

- `bsdiff-macos.test.js`
- `ffi-macos.test.js`
- `ref-macos.test.js`
- `ref-struct-macos.test.js`
- `ref-union-macos.test.js`
- `node-7z-macos.test.js`

## Benefits

1. **Performance:** Native implementations are faster than mock implementations
2. **Reliability:** Real functionality reduces unexpected behavior
3. **Compatibility:** Maintains API compatibility with existing code
4. **User Experience:** Better error messages guide users to install required dependencies

## Future Improvements

1. **ffi:** Implement full libffi integration for real foreign function calls
2. **ref modules:** Integrate with actual memory management APIs
3. **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling with more specific error types
4. **Performance:** Optimize implementations for better performance

## Installation Requirements

Some implementations require additional system tools:

```bash
# Install bsdiff for bsdiff-node functionality
brew install bsdiff

# Install 7-Zip for node-7z functionality
brew install p7zip
```

These tools are commonly available and provide the underlying functionality for the native implementations.
