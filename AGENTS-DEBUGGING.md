# VS Code Debugging

- **F5** - Debug both main and renderer processes
- **Build first** - Always run `yarn build` before debugging
- Main process breakpoints: main entry and app directory
- Renderer breakpoints: renderer entry and views directory

> sewer note: This will be replaced with better .vscode config down the road.
> am just keeping this as a leftover note for now.
