# Extension Issues Fix Summary

## 1. Duplicate isWindows Declarations

### Issue
Multiple game extensions had duplicate declarations of the `isWindows` function:
```javascript
const { isWindows } = require('vortex-api');
// Platform detection
const isWindows = () => process.platform === 'win32'; // DUPLICATE!
```

This caused "Identifier 'isWindows' has already been declared" errors.

### Solution
Created and ran a script (`scripts/fix-duplicate-iswindows.js`) that automatically removed the duplicate declarations from 33 affected extensions:
- game-darkestdungeon
- game-dawnofman
- game-divinityoriginalsin2
- game-dragonage
- game-dragonage2
- game-enderal
- game-fallout4
- game-fallout4vr
- game-galciv3
- game-grimdawn
- game-monster-hunter-world
- game-mount-and-blade
- game-neverwinter-nights
- game-neverwinter-nights2
- game-oni
- game-pathfinderkingmaker
- game-prisonarchitect
- game-sims3
- game-sims4
- game-skyrim
- game-skyrimvr
- game-stardewvalley
- game-survivingmars
- game-sw-kotor
- game-teamfortress2
- game-teso
- game-torchlight2
- game-vtmbloodlines
- game-witcher
- game-witcher2
- game-witcher3
- game-worldoftanks
- game-x4foundations

### Result
All affected extensions now correctly use the `isWindows` function imported from vortex-api without duplicate declarations.

## 2. Platform Detection Comments

### Issue
After removing the duplicate declarations, many extensions were left with unnecessary "Platform detection" comments that no longer served a purpose.

### Solution
Created and ran a script (`scripts/remove-platform-comments.js`) that automatically removed these comments from 31 affected extensions.

### Result
The code is now cleaner without unnecessary comments.

## 3. Document Reference Issues

### Analysis
The following extensions were reported to have document reference issues:
- changelog-dashlet
- collections
- documentation
- feedback
- gamestore-origin
- gamestore-xbox
- gameversion-hash
- issue-tracker
- mod-dependency-manager

Upon investigation, most of these extensions don't actually have problematic document references. The only actual reference found was in the documentation extension, which uses `document.styleSheets` in a React component. This is appropriate as React components run in the browser context where [document](file:///Users/veland/Downloads/vortex/node_modules/@types/node/globals.d.ts#L195-L195) is available.

### Solution
The existing extension compatibility shim already handles document references appropriately by wrapping them in safe checks:
```javascript
fixedCode = fixedCode.replace(documentPattern, '(typeof document !== "undefined" ? document : undefined)');
```

No additional fixes were needed for these extensions.
