  - **dist/**: production builds (unpacked and installers, created during packaging)
  - **out/**: development build (created during build)

# npm tasks

- install: download & install dependencies, also downloads typings
- test: run test suite
- doc: create api documentation
- start: compiles typescript, updates all assets, then starts the program in

- package: creates a distributable installer. Also updates all assets and compiles
  typescript in the process
