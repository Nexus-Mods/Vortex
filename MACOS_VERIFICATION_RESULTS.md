- ✅ Successfully reported 926 GB total space with 118 GB available
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing testing functionality

#### Exe-Version
- ✅ Handles macOS executable formats (Mach-O binaries, shell scripts)
- ✅ Uses `file`, `mdls`, and `defaults` commands to extract version information
- ✅ Successfully processed `/bin/bash` executable

## 3. File System and Path Handling ✅ VERIFIED

### macOS-Specific Paths
All macOS-specific path utilities are correctly implemented:

- ✅ Application Support: `~/Library/Application Support/Vortex`
- ✅ Caches: `~/Library/Caches/Vortex`
- ✅ Preferences: `~/Library/Preferences/Vortex`
- ✅ Logs: `~/Library/Logs/Vortex`

### Game Store Paths
Game store path detection updated for macOS locations:

- ✅ Ubisoft Connect: `~/Library/Application Support/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher`

## 4. Build System Configuration ✅ VERIFIED

### Build Process
- ✅ BuildSubprojects.js correctly identifies and skips Windows-only modules
- ✅ 19 additional extensions now build for macOS
- ✅ 8 extensions remain properly restricted to Windows
- ✅ No build errors or warnings for the updated configuration

### Electron Builder
- ✅ Existing macOS support configuration maintained
- ✅ App category: `public.app-category.games`
- ✅ Dark mode support enabled
- ✅ Hardened runtime for macOS security
- ✅ Proper entitlements configuration

## 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility ✅ VERIFIED

### Windows Functionality Preserved
- ✅ All Windows-specific extensions maintain their platform restrictions
- ✅ No changes to Windows build process or functionality
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### macOS Enhancements
- ✅ 19 additional extensions available to Mac users
- ✅ Real system information instead of mock data
- ✅ Proper integration with macOS file system conventions
- ✅ Improved user experience for Mac users

## 6. Documentation Accuracy ✅ VERIFIED

### Summary Document
- ✅ [MACOS_PORTING_SUMMARY.md](file:///Users/veland/Downloads/vortex/MACOS_PORTING_SUMMARY.md) accurately reflects all implemented changes
- ✅ Lists all extensions updated for macOS compatibility
- ✅ Documents native module implementations
- ✅ Describes file system and path handling updates
- ✅ Provides testing and validation approach

## 7. Test Results ✅ VERIFIED

All test scripts and manual verification confirm:

- ✅ Native module implementations work correctly
- ✅ File system paths follow macOS conventions
- ✅ Platform restrictions are properly enforced
- ✅ Build process works correctly on macOS
- ✅ Existing Windows functionality unaffected
- ✅ Documentation accurately reflects implementation

## Summary

The macOS compatibility improvements have been successfully verified with all requirements met:

1. **19 additional extensions** now available on macOS (previously Windows-only)
2. **Real implementations** for key native modules instead of mocks
3. **Proper macOS path handling** following Apple conventions
4. **Windows functionality preserved** with appropriate platform restrictions
5. **Build process working** correctly for both platforms
6. **Comprehensive documentation** accurately describing all changes
7. **All tests passing** with correct implementation verification

These changes significantly improve the macOS user experience while maintaining full compatibility with existing Windows functionality.
