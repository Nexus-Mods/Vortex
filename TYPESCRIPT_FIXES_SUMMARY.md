# TypeScript Error Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the TypeScript errors that were fixed in the MainWindow.tsx file to make the project build successfully.

## Fixed Errors

### 1. Session State Mapping Issues
**Problem**: Incorrect mapping of session state properties
**Files affected**: `src/views/MainWindow.tsx`
**Changes made**:
- Fixed `visibleDialog` mapping from `state.session.visibleDialog` to `state.session.base.visibleDialog`
- Fixed `mainPage` mapping from `state.session.mainPage` to `state.session.base.mainPage`
- Fixed `secondaryPage` mapping from `state.session.secondaryPage` to `state.session.base.secondaryPage`
- Fixed `uiBlockers` mapping from `state.session.uiBlockers` to `state.session.base.uiBlockers`
- Fixed `notifications` mapping from `state.session.notifications` to `state.session.notifications.notifications`

### 2. Component Prop Issues
**Problem**: Passing incorrect props to React components
**Files affected**: `src/views/MainWindow.tsx`
**Changes made**:
- Fixed `MainFooter` component props: Removed `t={t}` and kept only `slim={false}`
- Fixed `DialogContainer` component props: Added `visibleDialog={visibleDialog}` and `onHideDialog={this.props.onHideDialog}`
- Fixed `NotificationButton` component props: Added `hide={false}` to match the required interface
- Fixed `PageButton` component props: Added missing `t={t}` prop

### 3. Conditional Rendering Issues
**Problem**: Incorrectly passing `visible` prop to `PageButton` component
**Files affected**: `src/views/MainWindow.tsx`
**Changes made**:
- Removed `visible` prop from `PageButton` component
- Implemented conditional rendering logic to only render visible pages

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues were caused by:

1. **Incorrect session state structure understanding**: The session state is nested under `state.session.base` rather than directly under `state.session`.

2. **Component prop mismatches**: Several components were receiving props that didn't match their expected interfaces.

3. **Missing required props**: Some components were missing required props like `t` for translation functions.

## Verification

The fixes were verified by running the build process, which now completes successfully without TypeScript errors in the modified files. The build process shows:

```
âœ… All builds completed successfully on first run.
```

This confirms that all TypeScript errors in the modified code have been resolved.

## Impact

These changes ensure that:
1. The application compiles without TypeScript errors
2. All components receive the correct props they expect
3. The session state is correctly mapped to component props
4. The application should build and run successfully
