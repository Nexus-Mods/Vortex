# macOS Performance Optimizations for Vortex

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of macOS-specific performance optimizations for Vortex, providing better responsiveness and efficiency on macOS platforms.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Module (src/util/macosPerformance.ts)
- `applyMacOSPerformanceOptimizations()` - Applies all macOS performance optimizations
- `boostPerformance()` - Temporarily boosts performance for critical operations
- `cleanupPerformanceOptimizations()` - Cleans up performance optimizations when needed
- `optimizeFileIO()` - Optimizes file I/O operations for better performance
- `monitorPerformance()` - Monitors and reports performance metrics

### 2. Optimization Techniques

#### Power Save Blocker
- Prevents macOS from throttling the application during critical operations
- Uses Electron's powerSaveBlocker API with 'prevent-app-suspension' mode
- Automatically cleans up when the application quits

#### Background Throttling
- Disables background throttling to maintain performance when the window is not focused
- Ensures smooth operation even when Vortex is running in the background

#### Window Settings Optimization
- Optimizes window rendering settings for better performance
- Sets up efficient task scheduling using requestIdleCallback when available

#### Event Listener Optimization
- Sets up performance-related event listeners for system power events
- Adjusts performance settings based on window focus/blur events

#### File I/O Optimization
- Optimizes file operations for better performance on macOS
- Uses asynchronous operations and efficient file system APIs

### 3. Application Integration (Application.ts)
- Added performance optimization initialization during UI startup
- Integrated with existing macOS-specific initialization
- Proper error handling for performance-related operations

## Features
1. **System Throttling Prevention** - Prevents macOS from throttling Vortex during critical operations
2. **Background Performance** - Maintains performance even when running in the background
3. **Memory Optimization** - Efficient memory usage with proper cleanup
4. **File I/O Optimization** - Optimized file operations for better performance
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in performance monitoring and reporting
6. **Graceful Degradation** - Integration only active on macOS platforms

## Technical Notes
- Performance optimizations use Electron's powerSaveBlocker and webContents APIs
- Background throttling is disabled to maintain consistent performance
- File I/O operations are optimized for macOS file system characteristics
- Integration is only enabled on macOS platforms
- Error handling prevents crashes from performance-related issues

## Configuration
No additional configuration is required. The optimizations are automatically applied on macOS platforms when the application starts.

## Testing
The implementation has been tested for:
- Proper optimization initialization on macOS
- Correct power save blocker management
- Graceful degradation on non-macOS platforms
- Integration with existing Vortex functionality
- Error handling for performance-related operations

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements could include:
- Adaptive performance scaling based on system resources
- More granular control over performance settings
- Integration with macOS Energy Saver preferences
- Advanced memory management techniques
- GPU acceleration optimization for rendering
- Network I/O optimization for downloads and updates
