# Fix for drivelist Windows Binary Compilation Issue

## Problem
The drivelist module was trying to compile Windows binaries during the build process on macOS, causing build errors and warnings. There was also a dependency conflict between the drivelist versions specified in the main package.json and app/package.json files.

## Solution
Made several targeted changes to prevent drivelist from compiling Windows binaries on macOS and ensure it uses the proper macOS implementation:

### 1. Fixed Dependency Conflict
- Removed drivelist from optionalDependencies in package.json to resolve version conflict
- Fixed missing comma in app/package.json that was causing JSON parsing errors

### 2. Enhanced Native Module Configuration
- Updated `scripts/configure-native-modules.js` to skip drivelist native module building on macOS when a real implementation exists
- Added specific environment variables to prevent drivelist Windows binary compilation

### 3. Improved Patching Script
- Modified `scripts/patch-native-modules.js` to:
  - Install real macOS implementation of drivelist instead of mocks
  - Set `"gypfile": false` in the installed drivelist package.json to prevent native compilation
  - Add additional drivelist-specific environment variables to prevent Windows binary compilation

### 4. Enhanced Post-install Verification
- Updated `postinstall.js` to properly detect and use the real drivelist implementation on macOS

## Results
- drivelist no longer attempts to compile Windows binaries during build process on macOS
- Uses real macOS implementation that leverages system commands (df, diskutil) instead of native modules
- All package validation checks now pass
- Build process completes without drivelist-related errors or warnings

## Testing
- Verified that `yarn run check_packages` passes
- Confirmed that drivelist module is properly installed with real macOS implementation
- Verified that package.json shows `"gypfile": false` to prevent native compilation
- Tested that the drivelist module functions correctly with the macOS-specific implementation
