# Promise Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to complete the migration from Bluebird promises to native JavaScript promises in the Vortex codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated src/renderer.tsx

- Added import for `promiseMap` helper function from `./util/bluebird-migration-helpers.local`
- Replaced `Promise.map(dynamicExts, ...)` with `promiseMap(dynamicExts, ...)`
- This change affects the language loading functionality for dynamic extensions

### 2. Updated extensions/games/game-darkestdungeon/index.js

- Added import for `promiseMap` helper function from `../../../src/util/bluebird-migration-helpers.local`
- Replaced `Promise.map(files, ...)` with `promiseMap(files, ...)`
- This change affects the directory walking functionality for Darkerst Dungeon game extension

### 3. Updated extensions/games/game-greedfall/index.js

- Added import for `promiseMap` helper function from `../../../src/util/bluebird-migration-helpers.local`
- Replaced `Promise.map(deployment[''], ...)` with `promiseMap(deployment[''], ...)`
- This change affects the file timestamp updating functionality for Greedfall game extension

## Verification

All modified files were checked for syntax errors and are readable. The changes follow the established pattern of using helper functions from `bluebird-migration-helpers.local.ts` to replace Bluebird-specific methods with native promise equivalents.

## Impact

These changes complete the migration away from Bluebird promises in the identified remaining locations. The application should now be fully functional with native promises and free of Bluebird dependencies in these areas.

The helper function approach ensures that the functionality remains consistent while using native JavaScript promises instead of the Bluebird library.
