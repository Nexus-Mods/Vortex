# macOS Implementation Updates

This document describes the updates made to improve the messaging about native macOS implementations in the Vortex codebase.

## Overview

Previously, the console messages during installation and build processes referred to all non-Windows modules on macOS as "mocks", even when real native implementations existed. This was misleading to users and developers who might not realize that real functionality was available.

The updates provide more accurate and descriptive messages about what is actually being used on macOS systems.

## Updated Files

### 1. scripts/configure-native-modules.js

**Changes:**
- Updated the initial message about skipping drivelist building to clarify that a real implementation is being used instead
- Added a comprehensive check for all native macOS implementations
- Updated messages to distinguish between:
  - Native macOS implementations (real functionality)
  - Mock implementations (placeholders for functionality not yet implemented)
- Improved the final success message

**Example Messages:**
- âœ… Using native macOS implementation for bsdiff-node
- ðŸŽ­ Using mock for leveldown on macOS (native functionality not yet implemented)
- âœ… Native module environment configuration completed for macOS

### 2. scripts/patch-native-modules.js

**Changes:**
- Updated the description in package.json for native implementations
- Added a counter to show how many native implementations were successfully installed
- Improved messages for mock implementations to clarify they are placeholders

**Example Messages:**
- âœ… Installed native macOS implementation for bsdiff-node
- âœ… Successfully installed 9 native macOS implementations
- ðŸ”§ Using mock implementation for leveldown (native functionality not yet implemented for macOS)

### 3. postinstall.js

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive checks for all native macOS implementations
- Updated messages to clearly distinguish between native implementations and mocks
- Improved clarity about what happens when no implementation is found

**Example Messages:**
- Using native macOS implementation for diskusage
- Using mock for leveldown on macOS (native functionality not yet implemented)
- No implementation found for vortexmt on macOS, proceeding with verification

## Benefits

1. **Clarity:** Users and developers can now clearly see which modules have real native functionality on macOS
2. **Accuracy:** Messages accurately reflect what is being used rather than defaulting to "mock"
3. **Transparency:** Clear distinction between implemented functionality and placeholders
4. **Developer Experience:** Makes it easier for developers to understand the current state of macOS support

## Modules with Native macOS Implementations

The following modules now have real native implementations on macOS:

1. drivelist - Drive information using system commands
2. diskusage - Disk usage information using df command
3. exe-version - Executable version extraction using file/mdls/defaults
4. turbowalk - High-performance file system traversal
5. wholocks - Process file locking using lsof
6. permissions - File permission management using chmod/chown
7. bsdiff-node - Binary diff functionality using bsdiff/bspatch
8. ffi - Foreign function interface capabilities
9. ref/ref-struct/ref-union - Memory reference and structured data types
10. node-7z - Archive handling using 7-Zip command-line tool

## Modules Still Using Mocks

The following modules still use mock implementations on macOS:

1. leveldown - Key-value storage
2. modmeta-db - Database functionality
3. native-errors - Native error handling
4. original-fs - File system operations
5. vortex-api - Vortex API
6. winapi-bindings - Windows API bindings (not applicable on macOS)
7. node-addon-api - Node addon API
8. vortexmt - Multithreading
9. xxhash-addon - High-speed hashing
10. fomod-installer - FOMOD installation

## Future Improvements

As more native functionality is implemented for macOS, these messages will automatically reflect the changes, providing accurate information about what is available.
