# macOS Theme Legibility Fix - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of legibility improvements for the macOS theme in Vortex, addressing issues with white text on white or light backgrounds in the development button, dropdown error messages, and search box elements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Development Button Enhancement
**File**: `extensions/theme-switcher/themes/macos-tahoe/style.scss`

Modified the `.toolbar-version-dev` class to improve visibility:
- Changed background to `rgba(255, 59, 48, 0.2)` (semi-transparent danger color)
- Updated text color to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)` (high contrast white)
- Added border: `1px solid rgba(255, 59, 48, 0.4)`
- Added backdrop filter for macOS-style vibrancy
- Increased font weight to semibold for better prominence

### 2. Form Control Enhancement
**File**: `extensions/theme-switcher/themes/macos-tahoe/details.scss`

Updated the `.form-control` class for better text contrast:
- Increased background opacity to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)`
- Improved text color to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)`
- Added backdrop filter for depth
- Enhanced focus state with lighter background `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)`
- Improved placeholder text visibility with `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)`
- Added proper disabled state styling

### 3. Input Group Enhancement
**File**: `extensions/theme-switcher/themes/macos-tahoe/details.scss`

Enhanced `.input-group` styling:
- Improved addon background to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)`
- Increased addon text contrast to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)`
- Added consistent backdrop filter
- Enhanced button styling with better contrast
- Added specific styling for search input groups

### 4. Error Message Enhancement
**File**: `extensions/theme-switcher/themes/macos-tahoe/style.scss`

Added comprehensive error message styling:
- Enhanced error label styling with text shadow for better contrast
- Improved error border visibility with `rgba(255, 59, 48, 0.6)`
- Added subtle error background `rgba(255, 59, 48, 0.05)`
- Created specific styling for dropdown error states
- Added error focus ring with `rgba(255, 59, 48, 0.3)`
- Enhanced dropdown menu error item styling

## Validation
All changes have been implemented without syntax errors. The modifications:
- Maintain consistency with the overall macOS theme design language
- Improve text contrast ratios for better readability
- Preserve existing functionality while enhancing visual clarity
- Follow macOS design guidelines with appropriate use of translucency and vibrancy

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify development button visibility in different lighting contexts
2. Check form control contrast in various states (normal, focus, disabled)
3. Validate error message visibility in dropdown menus
4. Ensure search box text is clearly visible
5. Test in both light and dark macOS environments
