# Clean Install Validation Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The clean install validation script was failing on macOS due to issues with the `rm -rf node_modules` command. The problem occurred because the script attempted to directly execute shell commands to remove directories, which can fail on macOS due to file permissions, locked files, or other system-level protections.

## Solution Implemented
We replaced the direct shell command execution with Node.js built-in file system methods that are more robust across platforms:

1. **Replaced shell commands with Node.js fs methods**: Used `fs.rmSync` with retry logic instead of `rm -rf` shell commands
2. **Added proper error handling**: Implemented retry mechanism with delays for transient failures
3. **Maintained cross-platform compatibility**: Kept existing Windows-specific logic where necessary
4. **Added fallback mechanism**: If Node.js methods fail, fall back to shell commands with better error handling

## Key Changes Made

### Updated Validation Script
Modified `scripts/validate-clean-install.js` to use Node.js native methods for directory removal:

1. Added `removeDirectory` function with retry logic
2. Replaced `execCommand` calls for directory removal with `fs.rmSync`
3. Added fallback to shell commands if Node.js methods fail
4. Maintained all other functionality of the validation script

### Code Changes
```
// Enhanced function to remove directory with retry logic using Node.js fs methods
function removeDirectory(dirPath) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const maxRetries = 3;
    const retryDelay = 1000; // 1 second
    
    function attemptRemove(attempt) {
      // Try to remove directory using fs.rmSync (Node.js 14.14.0+)
      try {
        fs.rmSync(dirPath, { recursive: true, force: true, maxRetries: 3 });
        resolve();
      } catch (err) {
        if (attempt < maxRetries) {
          console.warn(`Warning: Could not remove ${dirPath} directly, retrying in ${retryDelay}ms...`);
          setTimeout(() => attemptRemove(attempt + 1), retryDelay);
        } else {
          // Last resort: try with shell command but with better error handling
          const command = isWindows() ? `rmdir /s /q "${dirPath}"` : `rm -rf "${dirPath}"`;
          execCommand(command, { cwd: process.cwd() })
            .then(resolve)
            .catch(shellError => {
              reject(new Error(`Failed to remove directory ${dirPath} after ${maxRetries} attempts. Native error: ${err.message}. Shell error: ${shellError.message}`));
            });
        }
      }
    }
    
    attemptRemove(1);
  });
}
```
