   * Constructor
   * @param limit number of operations enqueued with do() that will happen concurrently
   * @param repeatTest if set, this function is called when an error happens and it can
   *                   decide if the operation should be retried.
   *                   This is purely a convenience feature but usually if you want to limit
   *                   concurrency it's because you're worried that some resource will run out
   *                   and it's not usually possible to know in advance how many operations
   *                   exactly can happen in parallel so you will usually still want to
   *                   handle errors that indicate the resource running out separately
