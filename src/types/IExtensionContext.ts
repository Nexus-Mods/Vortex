/**
 * The extension context is an object passed into all extensions during initialisation.
 *
 * There are three main parts to this object:
 * a) api. This is an object that contains various functions and objects to interact with the
 *    main application. During runtime of the application (that is: after the startup phase)
 *    this will be the only part of the context object you need.
 *    Most importantly it gives you access to the application store (maintaining all state)
 *    and a bunch of "stateful" convenience functions (stuff like displaying notifications/
 *    dialogs in a way consistent with the remaining application).
 * b) register functions. These must be called immediately inside the init function and they
 *    "inject" your extension functionality into the main function. That is: you register ui
 *    controls, callbacks, ... and the main function will then use that as necessary.
 *    Please note that a call to a register function has no immediate effect, those calls are
 *    stored and evaluated once all extensions have been initialised.
 *    An extension can add new register functions by simply assigning to the context object.
 *    There is one limitation though: Due to the way those functions are called you can't have
 *    optional parameters in register functions, the caller always have to provide the exact number
 *    of arguments to get the function to be called correctly. Vortex will pass additional
 *    parameters to the function that help identify the extension that called the function.
 *    These functions are then available to all other extensions, the order in which extensions
 *    are loaded is irrelevant (and can't be controlled).
 *    If an extension uses a register function from another extension it becomes implicitly
 *    dependent on it. If the register function isn't available (because that other extension
 *    isn't installed) the dependent extension isn't loaded either.
 *    To avoid this, call context.optional.registerXYZ(). Such a call will be evaluated if possible
 *    but won't cause an error if it isn't.
 *    Please note that context is a "Proxy" object that will accept calls to any "registerXYZ"
 *    function no matter if it's available or not. You can't "introspect" this object reliably,
 *    it will not show the available register functions.
 * c) once-callback. This is a callback that will be run after all extensions have been initialized
 *    and all register functions have been evaluated. This is still *before* a gamemode has been
 *    activated so you can't access game-specific data immediately inside once.
 *    It will be called only once at application startup whereas init is called once per process
 *    (that is: twice in total). It should be used for all your extension setup except for the
 *    register calls (i.e. installing event handlers, doing startup calculations).
 *    This is because at the time once is called, the context.api
 *    object is fully initialised and once is only caused if your extension should really load
 *    (as in: it's compatible with the current api).
