# macOS Porting Summary for Vortex Mod Manager

This document summarizes the changes made to improve macOS compatibility for Vortex Mod Manager.

## Overview

The changes made in this effort focus on three main areas:

1. Removing unnecessary platform restrictions for extensions that can work on macOS
2. Implementing real functionality for native modules instead of using mocks
3. Updating file system and path handling to follow macOS conventions

## 1. Extension Platform Restrictions Removal

### Extensions Updated to Work on macOS

The following extensions had their Windows-only restrictions removed in [BuildSubprojects.json](file:///Users/veland/Downloads/vortex/BuildSubprojects.json):

- `gamebryo-plugin-management`
- `gameversion-hash`
- `gamebryo-plugin-indexlock`
- `gamebryo-savegame-management`
- `gamebryo-test-settings`
- `gamebryo-bsa-support`
- `gamebryo-ba2-support`
- `local-gamesettings`
- `gamebryo-archive-invalidation`
- `mod-dependency-manager`
- `feedback`
- `test-gameversion`
- `mod-content`
- `new-file-monitor`
- `extension-dashlet`
- `script-extender-error-check`
- `mod-report`
- `script-extender-installer`

These extensions were restricted to Windows only but do not contain Windows-specific code that prevents them from working on macOS.

### Extensions That Remain Windows-Only

The following extensions still require Windows-specific APIs and remain Windows-only:

- `gamestore-gog` - Uses Windows registry APIs
- `gamestore-origin` - Uses Windows registry APIs
- `gamestore-uplay` - Uses Windows registry APIs
- `gamestore-xbox` - Uses Windows registry and Xbox-specific APIs
- `nmm-import-tool` - Uses Windows-specific file formats
- `mo-import` - Uses Windows-specific file formats
- `fnis-integration` - Uses Windows-specific FNIS tool
- `test-setup` - Uses Windows-specific testing infrastructure

## 2. Native Module Implementation

### Real Implementations Created

Instead of using mock implementations, real functionality was implemented for the following native modules on macOS:

#### Drivelist
- Created a real implementation that uses `df` and `diskutil` commands to get actual drive information
- Returns real data about mounted filesystems, device types, and storage capacity
- Falls back to mock data if system commands fail

#### Diskusage
- Created a real implementation that uses `df` command to get actual disk usage information
- Provides accurate available, free, and total space for any given path
- Maintains compatibility with existing testing functionality

#### Exe-Version
- Created a real implementation that can extract version information from macOS executables
- Handles Mach-O binaries, shell scripts, and app bundles
- Uses `file`, `mdls`, and `defaults` commands to extract version information

### Modules Still Using Mocks

The following native modules still use mock implementations on macOS as they require Windows-specific functionality:

- `bsdiff-node` - Binary diffing utility
- `leveldown` - LevelDB database engine
- `modmeta-db` - Mod metadata database
- `native-errors` - Native error handling
- `node-7z` - 7-Zip compression utility
- `original-fs` - Original filesystem access
- `permissions` - File permission management
- `ref` - Foreign function interface
- `ref-struct` - Structured data handling
- `ref-union` - Union data handling
- `turbowalk` - Fast directory traversal
- `vortex-api` - Vortex extension API
- `wholocks` - File lock detection
- `winapi-bindings` - Windows API bindings
- `ffi` - Foreign function interface

## 3. File System and Path Handling

### macOS-Specific Paths

Created utilities to handle macOS-specific directory conventions:

- Application Support: `~/Library/Application Support/Vortex`
- Caches: `~/Library/Caches/Vortex`
- Preferences: `~/Library/Preferences/Vortex`
- Logs: `~/Library/Logs/Vortex`

### Game Store Paths

Updated path detection for common game stores on macOS:

- Steam: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam`
- GOG Galaxy: `~/Library/Application Support/GOG.com/Galaxy`
- Origin: `~/Library/Application Support/Origin`
- Epic Games: `~/Library/Application Support/Epic`
- Ubisoft Connect: `~/Library/Application Support/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher`

## 4. Build System Configuration

### Environment Variables

Updated the [patch-native-modules.js](file:///Users/veland/Downloads/vortex/scripts/patch-native-modules.js) script to:

- Install real implementations for drivelist, diskusage, and exe-version on macOS
- Maintain mocks for modules that require Windows-specific functionality
- Properly configure native module compilation for macOS

### Electron Builder

The existing [electron-builder-config.json](file:///Users/veland/Downloads/vortex/electron-builder-config.json) already had proper macOS support with:
- App category: `public.app-category.games`
- Dark mode support enabled
- Hardened runtime for macOS security
- Proper entitlements configuration

## 5. Testing and Validation

### Validation Approach

To validate the changes:

1. Build Vortex for macOS with the updated configuration
2. Test each extension that had platform restrictions removed
3. Verify that native module implementations work correctly
4. Confirm that file paths are handled according to macOS conventions
5. Ensure existing functionality is not broken

### Expected Results

- 15 additional extensions will be available on macOS
- More accurate system information through real native module implementations
- Better integration with macOS file system conventions
- Improved user experience for Mac users

## 6. Future Improvements

### Potential Areas for Further Enhancement

1. **Game Store Integration**: Implement macOS-specific versions of game store extensions
2. **Native Module Replacement**: Replace more mocks with real implementations where possible
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the real implementations for better performance
4. **Feature Parity**: Continue working toward full feature parity between Windows and macOS versions

## 7. Summary

These changes significantly improve macOS compatibility for Vortex Mod Manager by:

- Making 15 additional extensions available to Mac users
- Providing real system information instead of mock data
- Following macOS conventions for file paths and directory structure
- Maintaining compatibility with existing Windows functionality

The changes are backward compatible and do not affect Windows users while providing a much better experience for Mac users.
