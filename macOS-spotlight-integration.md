# macOS Spotlight Integration for Vortex

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of native macOS Spotlight integration for Vortex, providing quick actions and search capabilities for macOS users.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies
- Added `electron-spotlight` dependency to package.json for macOS Spotlight integration
- The module is dynamically imported only on macOS platforms

### 2. Core Module (src/util/macosSpotlight.ts)
- `initializeSpotlight()` - Initializes the Spotlight integration
- `addSpotlightItems()` - Adds items to the Spotlight index
- `removeSpotlightItems()` - Removes specific items from the Spotlight index
- `removeAllSpotlightItems()` - Removes all items from the Spotlight index
- `indexVortexActions()` - Indexes common Vortex actions for quick access
- `indexRecentMods()` - Indexes recently used mods for search
- `indexGames()` - Indexes game entries for search

### 3. Main Process Integration (main.ts)
- Added Spotlight initialization during macOS app startup
- Automatically indexes common Vortex actions for quick access
- Integrated with existing Touch Bar and accessibility implementations

## Features
1. **Quick Actions** - Common Vortex actions accessible through Spotlight search:
   - Refresh Vortex
   - Open Settings
   - Manage Profiles
   - View Mods
   - Open Dashboard
   - Check for Updates

2. **Content Indexing** - Game and mod entries searchable through Spotlight
3. **Dynamic Updates** - Spotlight index updates as content changes in Vortex
4. **Graceful Degradation** - Integration only active on macOS platforms

## Technical Notes
- Spotlight integration uses the electron-spotlight module
- Items are indexed with unique IDs to allow for updates and removal
- Integration is only enabled on macOS platforms
- Error handling prevents crashes from Spotlight-related issues
- Actions are indexed with appropriate icons for visual recognition

## Configuration
No additional configuration is required. The integration is automatically enabled on macOS platforms when the application starts.

## Testing
The implementation has been tested for:
- Proper Spotlight integration initialization on macOS
- Correct indexing of Vortex actions
- Graceful degradation on non-macOS platforms
- Integration with existing Vortex functionality
- Error handling for Spotlight-related operations

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements could include:
- Indexing of specific mod and game content
- Custom Spotlight categories for Vortex content
- Integration with macOS Shortcuts app
- Parameterized actions for advanced workflows
- Rich previews for indexed content
